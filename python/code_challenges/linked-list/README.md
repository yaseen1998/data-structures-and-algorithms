# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
I used insert functoin to insert element in list by using linked list and I check if the element is exist or not

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
how to used linkedlist ot inser element and check if is exist or not

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
use pointer
in includes Big O = O(n)
in insert Big O =O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
first method is : insert : it add element in list
second methoe is  :includes : it check if the element is exist or not
third method is to_srting : it print the result like string

second class : Node it pointer in the next value


## Task test

Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list (done in test 1)

Can properly insert into the linked list (done with test 2)

The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list (done within code)

Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list (done with test 3)

Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists ( done with test 4)

Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist ( done wiith test 5)

Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list ( done with test 2 and 3 )
