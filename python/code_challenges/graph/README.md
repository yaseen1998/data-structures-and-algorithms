# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
graph : A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. 
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
in add Node is O(1)
in add edge is O(n)
in get node is O(1)
in get nihgboar is O(1)
in size is O(1)
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->
add node fuction : Add a node to the graph
add edge function : Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
If specified, assign a weight to the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
get node function : print all values
get nighboar funcrion : print connect node 
size function : return len of graph
