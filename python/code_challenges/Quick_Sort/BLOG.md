 I/P => [10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70]
 in first itration pivot = 70 then make every thin greater than 70 in the right and smaller than in left
 first => left=>[10,30,40,50] ,right[90,80]
 second iteration make quick sort for left
 second => pivot = 50 , [10,30,40]
 third => pivot = 40 , [10,30]
 fourth => pivot = 30 ,[10]

 then go in the greate than 70
 second => pivote 80 =>[80,90]
 third => pivot 90 => [80]
